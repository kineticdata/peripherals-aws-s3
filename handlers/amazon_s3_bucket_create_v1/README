=== Detailed Description
This handler creates a new bucket on Amazon S3 and returns the location of the bucket created. 
This is done by using an account's Access Key and Secret Access Key to authenticate with the Amazon
S3 server and then creating the bucket using the parameters that the AWS S3 Create Bucket API accepts. 
This handler was build using the AWS Ruby SDK. Documentation can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v2/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#create_bucket-instance_method
